            <h3>5. Information on the transfer of personal data to a third country or international organization</h3>
            <p><i>MagicBook</i> bookstore is a global business and it, or its service providers, may process, transfer, and store information about our users on servers located in a number of countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including in the United States (where data protection laws may be less stringent than in the country where you live).  Since we are committed to protecting your information, we take steps to ensure that there are appropriate safeguards in place when we transfer that data. To ensure that your data is adequately protected, we only transfer your data subject to suitable safeguards being in place, such as through Privacy Shield certified organizations.</p>

            <h3>8. The existence of data subject rights</h3>
            <p>If you live in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data.  If you wish to exercise these rights with regards to your personal data that we hold, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@magicbook.com">info@magicbook.com</a>. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country.  These include: 
	            <ul>
	            	<li><i>- The right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your information and your rights (which is why we are providing you with the information in this Policy).</i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to obtain access to your information (if we are processing it).</i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to have your information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete. You can do this through your account page or by contacting us.</i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to “block” or suppress further use of your information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but may not use it further.  We keep lists of people who have asked for further use of their information to be “blocked” to make sure the restriction is respected in future.</i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to request that we delete or remove your data where there is no compelling reason for us to keep using it.  This is not a general right to erasure; there are exceptions.</i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you or another service provider.</i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to object to certain types of processing, including processing for direct marketing (i.e., if you no longer want to be contacted with potential opportunities). If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. </i></li>
	            	<li><i>- The right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.</i></li>
	            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Pursuant to applicable data protection law, we may be entitled to refuse to act on the request.  To make these requests, please submit your name, address, and email address, in addition to the specifics of your request, to <a href="mailto:info@magicbook.com">info@magicbook.com</a>.</p>
            
            <h3>9. ABA</h3>
            <p>Our store is hosted by the American Bookseller's Association. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. Your Data is stored through ABA's data storage and databases. They store your Data on a secure server behind a firewall. If you choose a direct payment through our IndieCommerce store to complete your purchase, then your credit card data is stored through a PCI-DSS compliant 3rd party credit card gateway. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). No credit card data is stored on IndieCommerce servers. Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted, unless you set up an account and opted to store credit card information for future purchases. All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.</p>
            
            <h3>10. Other Third-Party Services</h3>
            <p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your Data to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us. However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions. For these providers, we recommend that you read their privacy policies so you can understand the manner in which your personal information will be handled by these providers. In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located. As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the Patriot Act.  When you click on links on our Website, they may direct you away from our Website. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites and encourage you to read their privacy statements. Once you leave our Website or are redirected to a third-party website or application, you are no longer governed by this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>
            <p>Here are links to privacy policies for some of the third party services we use: 
            	<ul>
            		<li><i>- PayPal Privacy Policy:  <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full">https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full</a></i></li>
            		<li><i>- Google Analytics Privacy Policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en ">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a></i></li>

          		</ul>
          	</p>
          
            <h3>11. Disclosure of your information</h3>
            <p>We will not sell, trade, rent or disclose your Data to third parties, except in certain circumstances described below: (a) We will disclose Data (i) if it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; (ii) if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; (iii) to protect our rights, reputation, property, or the safety of us or others; (iv) to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; (v) if the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; (vi) to a third party with your prior consent; (vii) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Data in order to enforce or apply any contracts or agreements that may exist between you and us, including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service found on our Website; and/or (viii) if we are required to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction. (b) We obtain support through third party service providers to maintain our Website, offer our products for sale, process customer orders, and deliver products. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our Website and we provide order information to third parties that may package and deliver your product order.</p>
            
            <h3>12. Data Security</h3>
            <p>To protect your personal information, we take reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices to make sure it is not inappropriately lost, misused, accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed. If you provide us with your credit card information, the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL) and stored with a AES-256 encryption. We follow all PCI-DSS requirements and implement additional generally accepted industry standards. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Data, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet that are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and Data exchanged between you and us through our Website cannot be guaranteed and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of such information; and (c) any such information and Data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party. In the unlikely event that we believe the security of your Data in our control may have been compromised, we will try to notify you. To the extent you have provided us with your email address, we may notify you by email and you agree to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@magicbook.com">info@magicbook.com.</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
            
            <h3>13. Age of Consent</h3>
            <p>We are not a site targeted at children or those under the age of 16. By using our Website, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your country, state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your country, state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use our Website.</p>
            
            <h3>14. Changes to this privacy policy</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on our Website. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.</p>
            
            <h3>15. Contact information</h3>
            <p>If you would like to access, correct, amend or delete any personal information we have about you, register a complaint, or simply want more information email us at: <a href="mailto:info@magicbook.com">info@magicbook.com</a>.</p>
